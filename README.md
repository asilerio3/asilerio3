Hi, 
I am Adrian. 
I just finished my MS in Statistics.
I am heavily interested in the growing fields of Data Mining and Machine Learning. 
Regression is my favorite category of statistics, and I am most familiar with R, but have dabbled here and there in Python, SAS, and Minitab.

This site serves as a public forum for me to share my projects that I have worked on, or projects that are being worked on. 

Thanks, 
Adrian.
